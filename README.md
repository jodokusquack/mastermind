## MASTERMIND

This is the game Mastermind, played on the command line. 

The objective of the Codebreaker is to guess the Codemaker's Colorcode in 12 turns or less.
After each guess the Codemaker gives some hints about the guess that was made:

* White means one of the colors guessed was correct but in the wrong position.
* Green means one of the colors guessed was correct and also in the correct position.

The code consist of 4 colours in a specific order. Colours can appear more than
once in the code.

The following colors are possible:
* ![#ff0000](https://via.placeholder.com/15/FF0000) Red (r)
* ![#0000ff](https://via.placeholder.com/15/0000FF) Blue (b)
* ![#00ffff](https://via.placeholder.com/15/00FFFF) Cyan (c)
* ![#808080](https://via.placeholder.com/15/808080) Gray (g)
